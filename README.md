🗣️ Assamese GPT

📜 Overview
Assamese GPT is an AI-based chatbot and translator that understands input in English (or other languages) and responds fluently in Assamese.

The goal is to build a natural language model fine-tuned for Assamese language generation, supporting tasks like translation, chatting, answering questions, and localizing AI interactions.

✨ Features
✅ Translation from English (or other languages) into Assamese

✅ Conversational responses purely in Assamese

✅ Easy to extend with custom Assamese datasets

✅ Support for fine-tuning and model improvement

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

transformers (HuggingFace)

datasets

torch (PyTorch)

Model Base:
(can be customized) — starting from pretrained models like mBERT, XLM-Roberta, or T5 multilingual

🌍 Why Assamese GPT?
Assamese is a rich, vibrant language but underrepresented in mainstream AI models.
With Assamese GPT, we aim to empower AI applications for over 15 million Assamese speakers and preserve linguistic diversity.
